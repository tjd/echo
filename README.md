# echo
Code for Thagard's ECHO model of coherence.

This first commit is of the source code from http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/JavaECHO/jecho.html. This is an old-fashioned Java Applet, so it may be hard to get working!

There are other projects that implement version of ECHO, such as:

- A nice graphical implementation: https://hamschank.com/convinceme/

- Using ECHO (in Python) to solve Sudoku: https://github.com/MaxRae/ConnectionistSudoku/blob/master/ECHOSudoku.ipynb

- A command-line version of ECHO that uses more modern Java:  https://github.com/russellcameronthomas/JavaECHO_command_line
